          Hi there!  My name is Cory, I'm a native Texan, and have lived in the beautiful city of Austin since 2002.  I moved here for college and fell in love with the culture and the people of Austin. I've worked as a General Manager for a local farm to table restaurant called "Odd Duck" for the past seven years.  During this time I have grown into a patient and observative group leader, a multi-tasker, and honed my hospitality skills.  I feel like I have learned so much from my tenure in the hospitality industry.  Like many humans out there, quarantine gave me some time to think.  During this period of inner focus, I decided it was time to take on a new adventure.  So here I am! I am a student in the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp, and I am excited for what the future has in store for me.
