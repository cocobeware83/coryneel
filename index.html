        Hi there!  My name is Cory, I am a native Texan, and have lived in the beautiful city of Austin since 2002.  I moved here for college and fell in love with the culture and the people of Austin. I have worked as a General Manager for a local farm to table restaurant called "Odd Duck" for the past seven years.  During this time, I have grown into a patient and observative group leader, a multi-tasker, and honed my hospitality skills.  I feel like I have learned so much from my tenure in the hospitality industry.  Like many humans out there, quarantine gave me some time to think.  During this period of inner focus, I decided it was time to take on a new adventure.  So here I am! I am a student in the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp, and I am excited for what the future has in store for me.

          <p>Working with a team of five, we created a review site for Austin only restaurants.  We wanted to create a website that contrasted to other review sites, in that we only focus on positive reviews.  Eat Out Austin will guide you towards some of the best places to eat locally, and is accompanied by insider reviews and recommendations.  We interviewd chefs, restaurant managers, servers, and bartenders.  By using our site you have access to their favorite spots to eat.  Whether you're a local or a first time visitor, we hope that Eat Out Austin will guide you to your next great meal!</p>

          <p>Safe Travels! Is a result of my first interactive group coding project.  My team built a website with the purpose of providing readily available information to today's traveller.  With COVID-19 affecting about every aspect of our lifes, and making travel worldwide almost impossible, most have turned to domestic travel.  Safe Travels! in its nascency allows the user to access up to date COVID-19 data as well as extended weather forecasts for most US cities.  With time we hope to develop this website into a one stop resource for travel, including information pertaining to lodging, entertainment, and dining, with many more possibilities as user feedback is provided. </p>        </div>

            <p>As General Manager at Odd Duck I have had the immense privilege to interact with the farming community of central Texas.  I am lucky to have been able to meet some of the hardest working men and women, who work tirelessly to feed the people of Texas.  In this fast-paced, electronic driven day and age, it is truly humbling to meet true heroes.  We would be nothing without our farmers.
