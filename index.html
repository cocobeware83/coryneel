          Hi there!  My name is Cory, I'm a native Texan, and have lived in the beautiful city of Austin since 2002.  I moved here for college and fell in love with the culture and the people of Austin. I've worked as a General Manager for a local farm to table restaurant called "Odd Duck" for the past seven years.  During this time I have grown into a patient and observative group leader, a multi-tasker, and honed my hospitality skills.  I feel like I have learned so much from my tenure in the hospitality industry.  Like many humans out there, quarantine gave me some time to think.  During this period of inner focus, I decided it was time to take on a new adventure.  So here I am! I am a student in the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp, and I am excited for what the future has in store for me.

            <p>The Run Buddy webapage was my first project.  The Run Buddy team needed a webpage that allowed prospective clients to submit their information, and get in touch with a personal trainer.  The first iteration of their website was so successful that they were able to soon request improvements, upgrades, and to make their site mobile friendly.  This was a huge learning experience for me, and I'm proud to put my name on this project.</p>

            <p>Horiseon Social Solutions had an exisitng webpage, but the code needed some attention.  Several links were broken, and the code itself in need of clarification through semantic HTMl and descriptive CSS tags.   The end result is a refined page, and clean code that anyone can pick up from and continue to improve upon.</p>

            <p>As General Manager at Odd Duck I have had the immense privelege to interact with the farming community of central Texas.  I am lucky to have been able to meet some of the hardest working men and women, whom work tirelessly to feed the people of Texas.  In this fast-paced, electronic driven day and age, it is truly humbling to meet true heros.  We would be nothing without our farmers.
